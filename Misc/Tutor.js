// TUTOR SUGGESTIONS ON CODE to add



// example of a working addEmployee function at you, so you can see what I mean in terms of the code...



async function addEmployee() {
  const roles = await db.findAllRoles();
  const employees = await db.findAllEmployees();

  const employee = await prompt([
    {
      name: "first_name",
      message: "What is the employee's first name?"
    },
    {
      name: "last_name",
      message: "What is the employee's last name?"
    }
  ]);

  const roleChoices = roles.map(({ id, title }) => ({
    name: title,
    value: id
  }));

  const { roleId } = await prompt({
    type: "list",
    name: "roleId",
    message: "What is the employee's role?",
    choices: roleChoices
  });

  employee.role_id = roleId;

  const managerChoices = employees.map(({ id, first_name, last_name }) => ({
    name: `${first_name} ${last_name}`,
    value: id
  }));
  managerChoices.unshift({ name: "None", value: null });

  const { managerId } = await prompt({
    type: "list",
    name: "managerId",
    message: "Who is the employee's manager?",
    choices: managerChoices
  });

  employee.manager_id = managerId;

  await db.createEmployee(employee);

  console.log(
    `Added ${employee.first_name} ${employee.last_name} to the database`
  );

  loadMainPrompts();
}

Meanwhile, the findAllRoles() and findAllEmployees() 
methods live on the db constructor in another file.
That's ok if you don't make these methods, but they look like this...

class DB {
  // Keeping a reference to the connection on the class in case we need it later
  constructor(connection) {
    this.connection = connection;
  }

  // Find all employees, join with roles and departments to display their roles, salaries, departments, and managers
  findAllEmployees() {
    return this.connection.query(
      "SELECT employee.id, employee.first_name, employee.last_name, role.title, department.name AS department, role.salary, CONCAT(manager.first_name, ' ', manager.last_name) AS manager FROM employee LEFT JOIN role on employee.role_id = role.id LEFT JOIN department on role.department_id = department.id LEFT JOIN employee manager on manager.id = employee.manager_id;"
    );
  }

  // Find all roles, join with departments to display the department name
  findAllRoles() {
    return this.connection.query(
      "SELECT role.id, role.title, department.name AS department, role.salary FROM role LEFT JOIN department on role.department_id = department.id;"
    );
  }
